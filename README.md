# Heart Disease Data Visualization Practice

## Overview
This repository contains a visualization practice project focused on mastering 10 essential chart types using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
The goal is to create clear, interpretable, and publication-quality visualizations, not to build predictive models.

## Dataset/Quickstart
- This project uses the **Heart Disease Dataset** from Kaggle.
- Dataset is not included due to Kaggle licensing.
- Download from Kaggle and place `heart.csv` in the project root, or use Kaggle API in Colab.
- Run the notebook from top to bottom.
